# budget-buddy

## Project Description:

Our project revolves around financial analysis and budgeting of a typical user and focuses on reporting on the financial state of the user. The user is able to interact with the app based on their current and past budget. Potential extensions include financial document parsing, financial predictions on suggested spending, and data visualization for the user to easily recognize their current situation.

## Project Task Requirements:

<ins> 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete) </ins>

- Users add and delete income + expense items (name + amount) with a datestamp
- Saves “names” used and income sources
- Feedback → most spent, least spent, surplus/deficit
- Persistence of data → login on start

<ins> 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete) </ins>

- Users can categorize income + expense items → feedback reflects categorization
- Visualization → graphing of expenses/income
- Visualization → by category
- Financial goals (% of income, target amount, years) → input 2 → output 3rd
- Timeboxed data → ability to compare data

<ins> 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete 1!) </ins>

- Personalized goals dependent on category → limits
- Bank statement parsing
- Excel population

## Task Breakdown:
